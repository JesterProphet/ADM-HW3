The main notebook is `main.ipynb` (HTML version: `main.html`) which reads the module `engine.py`. In addition, we outsourced the functions for the crawling in `crawler.py`, the parsing in `parser.py`, and the preprocessing in `preprocess.py`. 

The image `cmd.png` is the screenshot of the command line output. 

The created map for question 4 is stored as `map.html`.

The shell script for the Command Line Question is `CommandLine.sh`.

**Note:**

- We directly executed the scripts `crawler.py`, `parser.py`, and `preprocess.py` in advance inside the notebook using the `subprocess` library.
- We created all the inverted indexes using functions stored inside `engine.py` which we then stored locally inside pickle files and loaded them for our engines later.
- We excluded for privacy reasons the real Google Maps API Key.
- We used the provided `kepler_config.json` to create our map in question 4.
