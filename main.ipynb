Finally, once you have collected numerical information, you likely will have different currencies: this can be chaotic, so let chatGPT guide you in the choice and deployment of an API to convert this column to a common currency of your choice (it can be USD, EUR or whatever you want).

In case we don't find any currency but the field includes the string `UK Fees:` we treat the retrieved fee as GBP. If we don't find any currency or we retrieve multiple currencies we exclude those cases because we don't have enough information to retrieve the correct fee.
