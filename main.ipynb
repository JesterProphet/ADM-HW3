Finally, once you have collected numerical information, you likely will have different currencies: this can be chaotic, so let chatGPT guide you in the choice and deployment of an API to convert this column to a common currency of your choice (it can be USD, EUR or whatever you want).

In case we don't find any currency but the field includes the string `UK Fees:` we treat the retrieved fee as GBP. If we don't find any currency or we retrieve multiple currencies we exclude those cases because we don't have enough information to retrieve the correct fee.

Such course aims at providing detailed and up-to-date lessons, also through individual laboratory practice, on the structure and function of gametes, on the biological and molecular mechanisms that control the interactions between sperms and oocytes, the fertilization process and the embryonic development. The students will acquire the most recent techniques to isolate, manipulate, and cryoconserve both animal gametes and embryos, as well as the techniques for their biochemical, genetic, morphological and functional characterization in the field of reproductive medicine. The Course is mainly student-oriented, providing a system of tailored tutorship, with periodically-administered check-in interim tests in all course units.</td>\n",

The ultimate aim of the Course is to train experts able to manage laboratories of medically-assisted reproduction both referring to humans and animals. Such course aims at providing detailed and up-to-date lessons, also through individual laboratory practice, on the structure and function of gametes, on the biological and molecular mechanisms that control the interactions between sperms and oocytes, the fertilization process and the embryonic development. The students will acquire the most recent techniques to isolate, manipulate, and cryoconserve both animal gametes and embryos, as well as the techniques for their biochemical, genetic, morphological and functional characterization in the field of reproductive medicine. The Course is mainly student-oriented, providing a system of tailored tutorship, with periodically-administered check-in interim tests in all course units.   \n",

The focus of technology related economy is drastically shifting towards electrically or electronically controlled autonomous digital systems, smart communication devices, automation and robotics, controlled remotely via smart technology using green energy resources. The postgraduate programme combines principles from electrics, electronics, control, power, automation and robotics to design, manufacture and test smart mobile vehicles/ devices, powered by green electricity. For various applications, these systems and devices are required to interact with objects, know where the objects are, and be able to perform tasks such as moving the objects to a required new position.   \n",

In addition to traditional careers in the chemical, energy and oil industries, chemical engineers enjoy increasing opportunities in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, electronic device fabrication and environmental engineering. Chemical engineers apply the principles of chemistry, biology, physics, and math to solve problems that involve the production or use of chemicals, fuel, drugs, food, and many other products. They design processes and equipment for large-scale manufacturing, plan and test production methods and byproducts treatment, and direct facility operations. In addition, chemical engineers work in the production of energy, electronics, food, clothing, and paper. They must understand how the manufacturing process affects the environment and the safety of workers and consumers.   \n",

In the last two decades, pioneering ecosystem health approaches were applied on the basis of physicochemical, biological and ecological parameters indicative of ecosystem welfare/harm. Despide of the great conceptual difficulty to cover the journey between values of individual parameters and the integrative measure of ecosystem health, the conceptual framework that integrates Environmental Contamination and Toxicology provides concepts and methods that, establishing cause-effect relationships with reasonable certainty, may be useful to interpret cost/effective data indicative of the ecosystem health status, exactly like biomarkers and bioassays are currently used in biomedical research and medical practice.   \n",

The ultimate aim of the Course is to train experts able to manage laboratories of medically-assisted reproduction both referring to humans and animals. Such course aims at providing detailed and up-to-date lessons, also through individual laboratory practice, on the structure and function of gametes, on the biological and molecular mechanisms that control the interactions between sperms and oocytes, the fertilization process and the embryonic development. The students will acquire the most recent techniques to isolate, manipulate, and cryoconserve both animal gametes and embryos, as well as the techniques for their biochemical, genetic, morphological and functional characterization in the field of reproductive medicine.

       "63                                       We do not know enough about the potential toxicity of the existing chemicals or the thousands of new ones being annually produced: we cannot test their toxicity to all species and thus effects of chemicals thought to be safe are constantly surprising us (i.e., endocrine disruptors, microplastics, nanoparticles etc.). In the last two decades, pioneering ecosystem health approaches were applied on the basis of physicochemical, biological and ecological parameters indicative of ecosystem welfare/harm. Despide of the great conceptual difficulty to cover the journey between values of individual parameters and the integrative measure of ecosystem health, the conceptual framework that integrates Environmental Contamination and Toxicology provides concepts and methods that, establishing cause-effect relationships with reasonable certainty, may be useful to interpret cost/effective data indicative of the ecosystem health status, exactly like biomarkers and bioassays are currently used in biomedical research and medical practice.   \n",

    "2. For this case, the average time complexity is somewhat tricky to compute because of the pruning done to remove branches where the target value is surpassed. However, we can compute that, in the worst case scenario, the complexity will be $O(b^d)$ where b is the branching factor in tree-like problems, it refers to the number of children of a node (here, the size of the interval between min and maxhours in a day) and d is the depth (maximum size of a path in the graph). This is because, in the worst case, no pruning is done and thus all possible paths are explored. In this case, for each level of the tree, we have to explore $b^{level}$ nodes if b is uniform. \n",
    "Thus, we have to compute $$\\sum_{i=1}^{d} b^i = b \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} b^{i} = b\\frac{1 - b^{d}}{1 - d}$$ Using the Big O notation, we can surmise that this equates to $O(b^d)$ in the worst case"

    "3. When asking the LLM (in my case, ChatGPT), the algorithm gives the same answer for the worst case scenario (which is not surprising as it is a very common result in algorithm theory) but gives an answer for the average case : $O(b_{avg} ^ {d_{avg}})$. However, the average case is not really useful for this case and serves only as an interesting mathematical tidbit.\n",
