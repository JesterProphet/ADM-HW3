Finally, once you have collected numerical information, you likely will have different currencies: this can be chaotic, so let chatGPT guide you in the choice and deployment of an API to convert this column to a common currency of your choice (it can be USD, EUR or whatever you want).

      "5   Chemical engineers are in great demand because of the large number of industries that depend on the synthesis and processing of chemicals and materials. In addition to traditional careers in the chemical, energy and oil industries, chemical engineers enjoy increasing opportunities in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, electronic device fabrication and environmental engineering. Chemical engineers apply the principles of chemistry, biology, physics, and math to solve problems that involve the production or use of chemicals, fuel, drugs, food, and many other products. They design processes and equipment for large-scale manufacturing, plan and test production methods and byproducts treatment, and direct facility operations. In addition, chemical engineers work in the production of energy, electronics, food, clothing, and paper. They must understand how the manufacturing process affects the environment and the safety of workers and consumers.   \n",

    "## 4. Visualizing the most relevant MSc degrees\n",
    "Using maps can help people understand how far one university is from another so they can plan their academic careers more adequately. Here, we challenge you to show a map of the courses found with the score defined in point 3. You should be able to identify at least the city and country for each MSc degree. You can find some ideas on how to create maps in Python [here](https://github.com/Sapienza-University-Rome/ADM/tree/master/2023/Homework_3#:~:text=maps%20in%20Python-,here,-and%20here%20but) and [here](https://github.com/Sapienza-University-Rome/ADM/tree/master/2023/Homework_3#:~:text=Python%20here%20and-,here,-but%20you%20will) but you will maybe need further information for a proper visualization, like coordinates (latitude and longitude). You can retrieve this data using various tools:\n",

    "1. [Here](https://github.com/Sapienza-University-Rome/ADM/tree/master/2023/Homework_3#:~:text=using%20various%20tools%3A-,Here,-you%20can%20find) you can find a helpful tutorial on how to encode geo-informations using Google API in Python (this tool can also be used in [Google Sheets](https://github.com/Sapienza-University-Rome/ADM/tree/master/2023/Homework_3#:~:text=be%20used%20in-,Google%20Sheets,-)))\n",
    "2. You can collect a list of unique places in the format (City, Country) and ask chatGPT (or, as usual, any other LLM chatbot) to provide you with a list of corresponding representative coordinates\n",
    "3. Explore and find the best solution for your case!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you defined your visualization strategy, include a way to encode fees in your charts. The map should show (with a proper legend) different courses and associated taxation: the user wants a glimpse not only of how far he will need to move but also of how much it will cost him!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to use the Google Maps client to retrieve the latitude and longitude given an address. First we retrieve the top 100 courses using our score from point 3. Then we concatenate the columns `universityName`, `city`, and `country` to create our new column `address`. By using this column we retrieve the coordinates of every course."
