Finally, once you have collected numerical information, you likely will have different currencies: this can be chaotic, so let chatGPT guide you in the choice and deployment of an API to convert this column to a common currency of your choice (it can be USD, EUR or whatever you want). Ultimately, you will have a float column renamed `fees (CHOSEN COMMON CURRENCY)`.\n",

In case we don't find any currency but the field includes the string `UK Fees:` we treat the retrieved fee as GBP. If we don't find any currency or we retrieve multiple currencies we exclude those cases because we don't have enough information to retrieve the correct fee.

It is widely used in mental health, occupational psychology, business management, education, health, criminology and law. This course is aimed at graduates who have previously studied psychology and want the opportunity to further their knowledge to an advanced level, as well as the chance to develop an understanding of how psychology is applied to a particular aspect of real life. Areas of applied psychology studied include educational psychology, child psychology, clinical psychology and counselling psychology.   \n",

    "## 5. BONUS: More complex search engine\n",
    "For the Bonus part, we want to ask you more sophisticated search engine. Here we want to let users issue more complex queries. The options of this new search engine are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Give the possibility to specify queries for the following features (the user should have the option to issue none or all of them):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `courseName`\n",
    "- `universityName`\n",
    "- `city`\n",

    "2. Specify a range for the **fees** to retrieve only MSc whose taxation is in that range.\n",
    "3. Specify a list of **countries** which the search engine should only return the courses taking place in city within those countries.\n",
    "4. Filter based on the courses that have already started.\n",
    "5. Filter based on the presence of online modality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 1:** You should be aware that you should give the user the possibility <ins>to select any</ins> of the abovementioned options. How should the user use the options? We will accept any manual that you provide to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 2:** As you may have realized from **1st option**, you need to build <ins>inverted indexes</ins> for those values and return all of the documents that have the similarity <ins>more than 0</ins> concerning the given queries. Choose a logical way to aggregate the similarity coming from each of them and explain your idea in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 3:** The options <ins>other than 1st</ins> one can be considered as filtering criteria so the retrieved documents <ins>must respect all</ins> of those filters.\n",
